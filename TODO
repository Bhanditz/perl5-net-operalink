* When an access token expires, handle it gracefully instead of crashing
  We could just catch 401s and reissue requests for req/access tokens

* Would be cool to empower datatype objects, to allow stuff like:

  my $link = Net::OperaLink->new( ... );
  my $bm = $link->bookmark('some-id');
  my @children = $bm->children();
